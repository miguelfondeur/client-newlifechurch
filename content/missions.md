				<h2>Advancing God's Kingdom</h2>
				<p class="text-justify">When Jesus returned to Heaven He had a plan for the Body of Christ to carry on His work and our primary goal is to provide opportunities to witness to and minister to those in need, both home and abroad.

				For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:  36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me... (Matthew 25: 35 & 36)
				</p><p class="text-justify">
				Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?  39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?  40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
