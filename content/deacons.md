				<p>Acts 6  1And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.   2Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.   3Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.  4But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.  5And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:  6Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.  7And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.

				The Deacons of New Life assist our pastor in the ministry acting as his right hands. They are the representatives of the growing membership of New Life. These men and their wives are on call to assist the members in a variety of ways. Along with their wives, they work in the ministry on bus routes, Sunday School teachers, Ministry leaders, boards and many functions of the church. They are the fullfillment of Acts Chapter 6</p>
