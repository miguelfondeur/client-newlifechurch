					<h2>The Butterfly</h2>
					<p>At New Life this iconic symbol is as God intended, a representation of the most amazing transformation and that of what God can do with the simplest of things.  He creates a symphony of beauty and grace from the basest of creatures, whose transformation alone is a miracle of his engineering.  Thus it becomes a representation of the new life in Christ shown in the lives of these ladies who declare their destiny in Christ Jesus.</p>
